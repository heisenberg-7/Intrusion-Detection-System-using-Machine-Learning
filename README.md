# THIS REPO HAS BEEN UPDATED WITH ONE EXTRA JUPYTER NOTEBOOK IN WHICH CHI-SQUARE TEST AND MULTICLASSIFICATION IS DONE.
LAST FEW CELLS MAY NOT WORK BECAUSE THEY WERE TAKEN FROM OTHER NOTEBOOKS JUST FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES <br>
ALSO YOU MAY NEED TO INSTALL GENETIC SELECTION AND IMBALANCED LEARN TO USE GENETIC ALGORITHM AND SMOTE RESPECTIVELY.<br>


# Intrusion-Detection-System-using-Machine-Learning
This is a project in which I have worked on NSL-KDD dataset and applied multiple machine learning algorithms to find best among them
<br>
Dataset used : NSL-KDD
<br>
ML Algorithms used: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest
<br>
<br>
Metrics : Confusion Matrix, Classification report, Accuracy score
<br>
This is a complete code having two jupyer notebooks naming mycode_final and mycode having only one difference of normalization technique and how to remove nan values.<br>
**mycode_final: standard scaler is used and mode is used to replace nan values**
<br>
**mycode: min-max scaler is used and mean is used to replace nan values**
<br>
Rest of the things are commented in the code itself
